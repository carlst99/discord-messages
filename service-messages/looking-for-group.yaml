      Welcome to the <#531917905600839680> channel! This channel is for finding an outfit or a squad of other players to play with! We strongly recommend using the following template to post a listing:

      **Character Name(s):** *MyNameTR, MyNameVS, etc.*
      **Server(s):** *See below...*
      **Faction(s):** *TR <:tr:441405413745754112>, VS <:vs:441405448113881098>, NC <:nc:441405432091901972>*
      **Description:** *When do you play? Do you stick to infantry? Are you looking to fly planes or drive armor, primarily?*

      This channel is not for general discussion or conversation, but directly answering listings with an invitation or asking for more information is fine. Messages posted here that are not directly related to joining a squad or outfit, including insincere listings, will be removed and may result in administrator/moderator action. Be sure to also check the listings in <#1049720477427450036>  -- outfits are the best way to find a group of players to squad up with whenever you want to play.
